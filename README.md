# Feature Toggles Visual Demo

![Build](https://github.com/andrej-dyck/feature-toggles-visual-demo/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

[Feature Toggles](https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html) are a powerful tool for development teams (including business persons) to deliver functionality quickly and safely, by decoupling code deployment from feature deployment.

> Feature Toggles decouple code deployment from feature deployment; thus, enabling true Continuous Delivery.

In simple terms, a feature toggle is an on-off switch for some part of the software system, which can be turned on or off after the deployment.

This mechanism enables teams to decide when a certain feature goes live, have a kill-switch when something isn't working as intended, not having unfinished code block deployment, do calender-driven launches, do A/B testing, and much more.

Further, this decoupling of code and feature deployment alleviates pressure from developers to _finish_ a feature, making _feature freezes_ and long-running feature-branches unnecessary, enables on-demand releases, and simplifies the workflow (cf. [trunk-based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/feature-flags/)).

You can find more information about feature toggles in the subsequent sections and provided links.

## üíª This Demo

This demo is intended as a presentation for non-developers to visualize how features toggles help development teams decouple code deployment from feature deployment.
